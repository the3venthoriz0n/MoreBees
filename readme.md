# More Bees
This is a mod for Lethal Company. It's exactly like it sounds; There are a crap ton of bees (and some other stuff).

Please note, I have absolutely no clue how to mod games and this is currently a little broken. Fixes on the way.


## Features
- Bees
- Unlimited Sprint
- A secret surprise

## Future Plans
- I plan to add unlimited sprint only while holding a hive
- More bees can never hurt

## Instructions
Place the ```the3venthoriz0n-MoreBees-x.x.x``` folder in your ```BepInEx/Plugins``` folder. (Or use the Thunderstore Mod Manager).
